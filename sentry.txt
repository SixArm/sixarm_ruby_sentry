Sentry is a web monitoring tool that loads a web page and times it.
Sentry reports errors with diagnostics, and can send these to email.

Syntax: sentry [-u URI] [-n LOOPS] [-s SECS] [-find TEXT] [-to EMAIL]

  --uri http://www.my.com  == specify URI to load
  -n 10                    == load the page n times, average the results
  -s 1.00                  == if average time > s then raise "Too slow"
  --include foo            == page text must contain 'foo'
  --exclude foo            == page text must NOT contain 'foo'
  --to me@my.com           == send errors to an email address

Example: how do I test the web page speed of my local machine?

  sentry --uri http://localhost

Example: how do I test the web page speed of another web page 5 times?

  sentry --uri http://www.my.com -n 5

Example: how do I test the web page speed of another web page 5 times,
ensure the speed is within 2 seconds, the page says "Hello" as it should,
and have any errors emailed to me along with various system diagnostics?

  sentry --uri http://www.my.com -n 5 -s 2 \
         --include Hello \
         --mail-to me@my.com
